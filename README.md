# SpatialTouchstone

## Abstract

Spatial Touchstone (ST) generated 69 experiments contains 7,458,953 cells and 127 experiments with 6,225,798 cells derived from Public Datasets(PUB), those data are stored in Spatial Touchstone Repository(STR) which now houses more than 14 million cells and 2.3 billion transcripts.

User-generated data, such as gene matrices produced by various machines, can be deposited in the Spatial Touchstone Portal (STP). This allows for the generation of QC metrics, enabling comparison with other data within the portal for quality checking. 

Additionally, our  [`SpatialQC Software`](https://github.com/Center-for-Spatial-OMICs/SpatialQC)R package can be used to generate technical metrics independently, and Single Cell Transfer functions are provided.

## Figure 1

Technical Metrics can be generated from our R package [`SpatialQC`](https:/om/Center-for-Spatial-OMICs/SpatialQC)

The Package can be downloaded from [R package](https://github.com/Center-for-Spatial-OMICs/SpatialQC)
